##### Paladin Ubers #####
Helm: UM'd Kiras Guardian Tiara (for resistance purposes)
Amulet: Maras (2 to all skills granted, 20-30 all resists, period.)
Weapon: Last Wish Phase blade (lifetap, 60-70% chances of Crushing blow -- having 65%+ from it will give you an even 100%)
Weapon switch: Call to arms (useless)
Armor: Chains of honor (dusk, wyrm, scarab or even ap can work -- I used a wyrm one)
Shield: Exile (vortex, zakarum shield or sacred targe would be the best options -- Look for a shield that has base resistances; 40-45)
Shield switch: Paly spirit (pretty self-explanatory)
Gloves: 20 IAS, Crushing blow, mods crafted gloves (The 20 ias is a MUST, otherwise, your smite speed will be lowered to 7 fpa. The CB will lead you around 100% -- Life, dex or resistance can be nice adds when looking for a pair)
Ring 1: Ravenfrost (20 dex, cold absorb -- nuff said)
Belt: Thundergod's Vigor (otherwise uber Mephisto can be a pain sometimes -- absorb is your friend)
Ring 2: Dwarf star (life and fire absorb are a plus)
Boots: Goblin toes (25% crushing blow -- way superior than goreriders. Upgrade them once if you wish)
